            A window will show up once the page is fully loaded. This window will say, "click on a location icon to know about a location"

            <strong>How will your users understand the primary objectives?
                </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the interface will be centered on a map, the user will assume that the primary objective is to get to know about the various cultural places in Hawai'i, which is part of the primary purpose.

            <strong>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the needfinding exercise, the interface will have to be simplistic. If the information is too detailed then an ever-present legend will be needed. Tooltips will keep the interface visually simple. Hover windows will be used to tell about the location and its history, and the user can click on the close button to close the informational window.

            <strong>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since there will be clickable icons on the map, the user will think to click on them to see what happens. The interface will be pretty simplistic so unless the user never used digital maps before, then it will take them a while to figure it out.
