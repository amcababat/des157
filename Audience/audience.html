        May Smith is a university student who studies economics at the University of California Davis. She comes from a middle class family with one older sister and one younger brother. It will soon be Summer Break, and she and her family won a two week vacation on Hawai'i. Since she and her family have been to this state before, her mother would like to know more about the history of Hawai'i than spend their time at the usual sandy beaches and luaus that most tourists go to.
