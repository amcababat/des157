        <h2>May Day</h2>
        <p>
            I am feeling overwhelmed over this project, as I still cannot think of what to do. Whenever I feel overwhelmed these days, my internal reaction is to think of my home state Hawai'i. Around this time, the students back home are already starting to think of May Day. For any school in that state, that is a day where the entire student body teams up with the faculty to create a performance where the students dance folk dances of the different cultures that came to Hawai'i.

            From those thoughts, and probably because I was homesick, I started to think of what can I do in this class that is still artsy yet still adheres to heritage. When I started to think about that question, I looked up things that are connected to interactivity, heritage, and arts. One of the <a href="http://public-repository.epoch-net.org/publications/VAST2005/shortpapers/short1026.pdf">articles</a> I found that tells of a project called the art-E-fact Generic Project. Its main goal is to create a platform for interactive storytelling in mixed reality. At the beginning of this article, it mentioned how "the human mind prefers stories because knowledge is contextualized and enmeshed in webs of meaning." I thought this interesting as I have never thought of what appeals to me about storytelling.

            Continuing my google search about interactivity, I came across this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/jul/12/interactive-technology-transform-storytelling-fiction">article</a> where it talks about how interactivity is changing people and about how it simulates alternative decisions. In it, the author mentioned about an app he made that required the user to run in real-life in order to escape the zombies in the game in order to get supplies. The reactions of the users were interesting as the author mentioned how some users were looking around their surroundings, looking for the zombies that exist only in the game. It was interesting to know how that game affected the players to that extent.

            A PhD student from USC was aiming for a similar goal. <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/interactive-storytelling-with-scalar/">Here,</a> PhD student Micha CÃ¡rdenas combined film, performance and poetry into an online interactive game. In this game, the player has to either confront the problems of climate change or to escape from the planet.

            I did another google search about what was being done about heritage through interactivity. I found a certain <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/events/event_IAP997558">event</a> that is an interactive workshop. This event served as a demonstration of their interactive discover heritage map. With this map, it demonstates how interactive media an community projects connect to the stories of students.

            From this research, I think I have a little more of a focus, even though my initial decision was to do something about animation. Perhaps I can incorporate some kind of animation, such as motion graphics. However, I want to do something similar to what the previous three resources did. I want to do something that celebrates the cultures that have come to Hawai'i. Upon stating that, perhaps my project will be based on some sort of interactive map that marks where the people come from.
