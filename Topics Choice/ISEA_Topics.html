        <h2>Sustainability</h2>

        <p>
            How do you get young people into it? How are we to turn materials such as plastic into something else? What kinds of activities or projects are being done today in support of sustainability? Maybe we can create an Instagram-like app to share the kinds of projects individuals do to show support for sustainability.

        <h2>Animation</h2>

        <p>
            This is something for me. I want to go into animation someday. I was thinking about what kinds of schools offer animation classes. So I thought that maybe a function for this project can locate schools (both university and community college) that offer animation degrees. Then I started to think that maybe I can create a free forum where aspiring animators can post their work for animation recruiters to see.

        <h2>Resources for Your Child of Genetics</h2>

        <p>
            This another personal topic for me because my brother was born with a genetic disorder called Angelman Syndrome, or AS for short. I read about how parents took their children to the doctor because they notice something wrong with their child only to be misdiagnosed. I was thinking that this can be an app that tells the symptoms of genetic disorders that causes developmental delay. This app can also tell the user of what can be done for the child or specifically who to see in the area. It may also be able to connect the parents to other parents with children of the same genetic disorder.
