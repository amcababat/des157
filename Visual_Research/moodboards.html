            Since the needfinding exercise, I began to think that having a world map for the user to explore would be too overwhelming. This first moodboard explored the idea of having pastel colors on the map itself. Then I would make brightly colored map icons that would have the countries' flag pattern. For example, there is a Japanese temple on the island I am from. The map icon marking that location would have the shape of the google map icon but would have the print of the Chinese flag on it.

            This moodboard explored the idea of having the map look like those x-ray maps. In this case, the brightly colored icons will stand out from the dark background. I don't know which one is more visually appealing.
