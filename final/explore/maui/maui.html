        <p>
            Named the Valley Isle for the two mountainous ranges creating central Maui, you may want to start your visit to this island by visiting <strong>Lahaina Town</strong>. It has 40 fine art galleries that features local artists. Several world-renowned artists have their own dedicated galleries on Front Street. It is also home to the primary harbor for snorkeling and whale watching. This is especially important during the spring when humpback whales use the warm shallow waters between the islands of Maui, Lana'i, and Kaho'olawe. Due to the town's location, it was once known as a Pacific whaling port during the early 19th century when whaling was at its peak.
