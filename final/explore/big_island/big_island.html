        <h2>Hawai'i</h2>

        <p>
            Because of its great landmass in comparison to the other islands, Hawai'i is better known as the <strong>Big Island</strong> and is the youngest of the islands. It is home to a wide range of climates from the volcanoes, snow cap mountains, waterfalls, deserts, and forests. If you want to see lava, then you can visit the <strong>Volcano National Park</strong>. Here, guests can hike miles through volcanic craters, scale deserts and rainforests. Because of its wide range in climates, This park was recognized in 1980 when it was named a world biosphere site by UNESCO, and as a World Heritage site in 1987.

            For those who are coffee lovers, they can visit the Kona Coffee Living History Farm. With its official name being <strong>D.Uchida Coffee Farm</strong> named after the farm's owner and developer, It is a tribute to Japanese immigrants who pioneered the coffee and macadamia nut industry on the Big Island from 1925 to 1945. Today, you can walk around the 5.5 acres farm and check out the nut orchard and processing mill.

            However, if you are one who wants to know how royalty lived, you can visit <strong>Hulihe'e Palace</strong>. This royal residence was built in 1838 out of lava rock, coral lime mortar, and koa and ohia timbers under the orders of Governor John Adams Kuakini during the mid-1800s. This palace served as his home until his death in 1844. The residence was passed down to his adopted son William Pitt Leleiohoku, who died only a few months later. This left the palace to his wide Princess Ruth Ke'elikolani who opened the palace to Hawaiian monarchy. Due to that hospitality, every Hawaiian monarch from Kamehameha III to Queen Liliuokalani spent their time at this residence.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1925, the palace was purchased by the Territory of Hawaii and turned over to and organization called the Daughters of Hawaii. The organization's mission is "to perpetuate the memory and spirit of old Hawaii and of historic face, and to preserve the nomenclature and correct pronunciation of the Hawaiian language." Forty-eight years later, the Hulihe'e Palace was placed on the National Register of Historic Sites.
