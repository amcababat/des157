        The book “Don’t Make Me Think” by Steven Krug focuses on how to design a website. According, to the author in the first chapter we should not make the user think at all. This can be achieved by organizing like-objects together in a group. Other techniques
        can include putting these objects in places where the user’s eye will go to and to not use jargon to further simplify the overall design. Another technique is to simply make the webpage obvious enough for the user to take one glance at it and summarize
        what the website is for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever the information is overly extensive, there will be times to meet a middle-ground between simplicity and extensive. On pages such as these, the designer will have to make sure the sure the user will only think a little more than the usual simplistic
        page.
      </p>
      <p>
    The reason why simplicity is valued is because competition is aggressive in the digital world and the general public often adheres to easy-use. If the design is too complicated to understand, the user will get too frustrated and will start to blame oneself
    as incompetent. As a result, the user will go to a less complicated interface, which will result in a loss of customers.
    </p>
<p>
    My reaction of this chapter is mostly towards one of the advices where author mentions to not put in any jargon into the design. While I do strive for a simple design, I believe this piece of advice applies only to the layout design. The content should
    not be affected by this piece of advice. Jargon is necessary as a marketing strategy and is capable of creating a community centered on that brand. An example would be a doll line that my niece loves called Monster High. Out of curiosity, I went through
    their website and found content locations that uses pun-like jargon in their content such as “scary cute” and “fangtastic.” I believe this sort of jargon-use is simply to strengthen the overall branding of the doll line as it was first launched. Considering
    that jargon-use was executed within the content of the website, I conclude that jargon-use should be used to appeal to a specific audience and only within the content itself.

            I think researching the suitable library for this studio was the biggest partof preparing for this project. I thought that since I was doing an interactive map, I should do a library that will help me make the interactive map. So I started on searching
            for libraries that will teach me how to do these things.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the first library that I found concerning interactive maps was jvectormaps. I tried to do the tutorials for it, but the download packet for that tutorial did not include all the necessary files. The tutorial was not detailed enough and in the end,
            I dropped it for mapbox.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mapbox is another js library that involves interactive maps. It seemed pretty simple so I started learning about that. The tutorial was very simple so I had an easy time on the getting started part of it. However, the tutorial did not include the fact
            that you can embed the map into the website. Nor did it give a tutorial on how to do so. The tutorials I found on youtube for that feature had horrible audio quality, so I basically spent up to 5 hours just trying to find a video that will
            teach me more about mapbox. Overall, mapbox is simple and the tutorial is great, but since it is a library, the tutorial they include on their website should include how to embed the map the user created into the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, I decided to start small with <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/"><strong>JQuery Mobile</strong></a>. Thankfully, w3schools teaches this library in a simplistic way without having to give you a packet. Like other libraries, all
            you have to do is link the library in the html file in the head and the html will have access to the JQuery Mobile library. Then you can start building the app in just the html file alone. Overall, Jquery Mobile is very easy to learn, the
            tutorial is simple and since the style is already embedded into the html, the designer does not have to worry about making the rough draft look professional.

            So the requirements was to create an interface that included at least three counters, tooltips with mouseover, and creatively include at least one time-based element. Since Valentine's Day was coming up, I thought it would be a good thing to do something
            celebrating the holiday. Therefore, I decided to make an interface similar to the ImageDemo exercise we did in class the other week. I made the hearts similar to the hearts given to us in class. The only difference is that I did not follow
            the usual messages heart candies have. Part of me thought this may be funny for the user, so I made the messages on the candies say things like "Fuck You" or "I guess" as answers to the tooltip question the Hover Me heart will show once the
            user hovers over that heart. This tooltip question is one of the three setTimeout functions we were required to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the other two setTimeout functions, they are located in the Today's date. When the user hovers over this, they will get today's date. The second function is located in the counter I made that is counting down the remaining time left of Valentine's
            Day. When the user hovers over that counter, the tooltip "Until Valentine's Day is over" will appear.

        <h2>Pocket Full of Interface</h2>
        <h3>What's in my Bookshelf</h3>

        <p>
            Since the goal was about telling the audience about ourselves, I thought this exercise was pretty easy. I decided to do something focusing on books because I am an avid reader. So I focused on what kind of books I buy these days. I decided to settle on
            Sci-fi, manga, design, and animation books. However, I thought simply including those would be visually boring for the user. Therefore, I decided to include other things that might be in my bookshelf, which were sketchbooks and plushies. I
            decided to go with a Stitch plushie because I have five Stitch plushies with me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I decided what visual of items to use, I made each of them in illustrator, including the bookshelf where the items will rest. Then I copied and pasted each of the visuals onto the bookshelf. This was to arrange them in an interesting composition,
            making sure the visuals were arranged in a grid because that would allow me to size the images exactly the same. When the bookshelf was done, I converted that image from a pdf to a png. From there, I saved the visuals of each item in the size
            I calculated by 6 of the bookshelf size.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it was time to code, I put the finished bookshelf png on first, using the position absolute function. I used the same function on each of the item pngs. In the CSS file, I made ids for each of the images to make sure they overlaying there positions
            in the bookshelf properly. Thanks to that, I had to put each image in a p tag and size that p tag width according to the images' width. In the js file, I created functions corresponding the ids that would effect the opacity so that when the
            user's cursor hovers over the image, the image would come into its full color. Since I thought the experience is about the items coming to alive in color, I decided to leave the background a slight gray color and also saved the png of the
            bookshelf in grayscale.
        </p>
        <p>
            After working on the bookshelf, I worked on the section that would tell the user about what the item tells about me. I created a functions in javascript with an innerHTML that will use the id I made called inner to insert messages based on what image
            the mouse will hover over. In order make sure the user will see this message even when scrolling down, I used the position fixed method to have the message stay in place.

            Since I am a UC Davis student. I often go onto the server to check my UC Davis email account. This is to see if I missed any announcements regarding classes, clubs, or events that are happening around the campus. When I was a freshman, I was really hated
            this page because I often had to log into my account because the teachers of the classes I took often made announcements that would often include the assignments made. Those announcements usually included sudden changes to the assignment (not
            including canceling the assignment), which I find was inconvenient if I was mostly done with the assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting aside my freshman immaturity, focusing the principles, in terms of clarity, the interface is clean at first glance. I do like how the most important parts such as the logo, username, and password are the biggest elements in here. Priority is present
            in how the size of the elements enforce hierarchy. Having the login button be the school colors brings about the principle of clairty in that the user is on a UC Davis server and brings about distinction.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of purpose, this distinction helps the user know that this is a login page and it is for the UC Davis students. The fact that the informational part of the page is in smaller text serves the purpose in letting the user focus on logging into the
            server.

        <h2>Paletton</h2>
        <img src="paletton.png" alt="Screenshot of Paletton" class="float-left margin-right">
        <p>
            I use the paletton interface for whenever I have to think of a color scheme for my designs. There are several reasons why I would recommend this interface; an overall reason is that the overall design allows the user to focus on the colors and the interaction
            between them. This is based on the fact that the whole interface besides the color wheel and square is dark gray. In terms of function, the controls in upperleft hand corner allows the user to think of how many colors a designer can work with.
            One can choose <b>monocromatic</b> (one hue) or one can choose a <b>tetratic</b> (four hues) scheme. If one chooses to work with more than one color for example a triadic scheme, then the interface can allow one to change the hues
            by dragging the little circles along the outer ring. </p>
        <p>
            However, the some of the most useful feature paletton has would be located on the right side of the picture. The dominating visual of this side of the interface is the square with multiple squares of varying sizes located at the bigger square’s corners.
            These smaller squares show the hue’s tints. By using this visual, a designer can analyze the interaction of colors whenever dealing with a multi-color scheme. Also, since designers have to think of how color look to people who cannot see colors
            the same as most people, paletton has a feature that allows the designer to see what the color-blinded people see.
