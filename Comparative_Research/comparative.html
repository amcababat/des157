            Two of the websites I have found in my research was for <a href="http://www.awn.com/">Animation World Network</a>. It is an online publishing group for animators and fans of the industry. Their website brings up news, articles, and links for professional animators and the fans. Their homepage is pretty simple, and at first glance, I did not think I was looking at a website from a professional company. I think it was mostly due to the ad box right under their header. For me, I would like to get rid of that because the nav bar, which is right below that box, is more important.

            In terms of content, this website seems to appeal to professional animators and aspiring animators. The News tab leads me to a page that shares recent events that happened in the animation industry such as selections for an animation festival and details on upcoming animated movies like <i>Smurfs: The Lost Village.</i> Through this tab, those in the industry can keep up with what is happening. For the aspiring animators, they can click the jobs bar to see where can they get a job in this industry. The events bar can show them animation events that are happening around the world. So this website is like a global network for the animation industry.

            Critically speaking though, the experience of this website is static. I thought the picture of the Oscar trophies was a slider. Also, the website does not seem to be responsive, which is usually something to be considered these days. I clicked on the tabs in the nav bar, and it for some reason, their design did not carry over to their jobs page as opposed to the other tabs that kept the design. Other issues I had over the tabs was that the tabs Home, AnimationWorld, and VXF World lead to the home page. Considering that their logo in the upper left corner is also a way to go back to the same page, the AnimationWorld and VXF World tabs are not needed. Besides that critique, I do like how this website can share what other people think on a certain work of animation through the news or blogs. Overall, I expected more in terms of design since this publishing company seems to be well-known.

            The second website is called <a href="http://www.cgsociety.org/">CGSociety</a>. CGSociety seems to be made for an audience of digital artist based on how there is a featured art bar. Like the AWN website, this website also features forums and news in the animation industry. However, the CGSociety seems to adhere more to telling people about other artists first while the AWN website focuses on sharing information. This is mostly on how the gallery tab is in a drop down menu for the AWN website while it is in plain sight in the CGSociety website. Another thing I noticed was that the CGSociety nav bar features less tabs, consisting of news, galleries, workshops, forums, CGS-TV, and careers.

            In contrast to the previous mentioned website, the CGSociety website is responsive, chaning format as I made the window smaller. Another differing feature is that once the website is fully loaded the featured art bar is coded to make the panels of artwork to turn like cubes, which I thought was an interesting thing to do with code. What the AWN website does not have is that there is a section that tells about workshops.

            However, scrolling down to the bottom of the careers page, I saw that the website charges companies for posting job openings. I assume that this website will allow one to apply to big companies if that company can afford to pay for job posting. Overall, the CGSociety is visually more appealing than AWN. I would like to know how were they able to create that 3D-like effect. I do like the idea that the AWN website can allow the user to read blogs on animation or look up different animation forums on the internet and that it tells of events.
