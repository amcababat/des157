    <h1>Needfinding for DES 157 final</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Extensive version is overwhelming</h3>
            <p>
                When the user zoomed in closely to the interactive part of the interface, she was overwhelmed with how much information is packed into a simplistic map. While it was amazing at how much research was invested into this interface, the user did not know what to do when faced with the extensive layers.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Simplistic version is better</h3>
            <p>
                The user mentioned that the simple version is better as it did not overwhelm her. It was also more aesthetically pleasing.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Fixed legend preferred</h3>
            <p>
                The user mentioned in having a fixed legend to the interface would have been better in her experience. It would have assisted her in navigating throughout the interface.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Color coordination is preferred</h3>
            <p>
                The color coordination was aesthetically pleasing against the black background.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Would have preferred to have intro and purpose come up first</h3>
            <p>
                It took a while for the user to encounter the introduction section and the purpose section. She said that she would have preferred to have those come up once the page loaded.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Tooltips were useful</h3>
            <p>
                Considering the vast information this interface had with the different icons, mouseover sections, and navigation methods, the tooltips helped the user a lot in what icon had what function.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Slide out</h3>
            <p>
                There were windows that contained information about the music genres the user clicked on. These windows slided out of the bar, which the user thought was a cool feature.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>One informational window at a time</h3>
            <p>
                However, these windows had the problem of having two windows being present and the same time. This feature confused the user and would have preferred to only focus on one window
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Have every icon have a function</h3>
            <p>
                At the bottom of every information window, there was a pulldown bar with three icons in it. Since there were three icons, the user thought each one had a function. However, that was not the case, as the only function was to bring up a list of subgenres of the music genre. Therefore, the extra two icons were unnecessary.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Zooms in at random areas</h3>
            <p>
                The user noticed that the interface map zooms in at random times, which she thought was unnecessary.
            </p>
