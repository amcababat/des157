            Thankfully, I received one reviewer per one side of the site. The first tester picked the Explore option first becuase she said that it sounded more vague so she was curious about what it had. From this tester, she said that the overall look of the graphics were good. Styling on the links could be better.

            The second tester chose history first because it was a topic that she was more interested in. Her critique was to create the photos in the history section more illustrated fashion to be more consistent. Another advice given was the keep the sans throughout the site. She also gave me an idea to have a sub menu for the site.

            Overall, the critique went well.
