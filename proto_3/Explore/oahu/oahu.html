        <h2>O'ahu</h2>
        <p>
            Named the Gathering Isle, this island is home to the majority of Hawai'i. Besides the great natural beauties such as Diamond Head where people may be able to se tiny diamonds (taking these as souvenirs is against the law) after a long hike, O'ahu is home to <strong>Aloha Tower</strong> the iconic symbol of the Hawaiian Islands built in 1926. Aloha Tower was the tallest building in the islands four four decades and its clock was one of the largest in the Unites States. The nearby whark was known for a celebration ceremony to welcome the arrival of visiting ships called Boat Days.

            This location is still a docking port of O'ahu's cruise ships. Today, you can walk around the surrounding marketplace and enjoy many experiences such as shops, live music, and art galleries located in Chinatown just blocks away. If you ever get tired on the ground floor, you can fo the Observation Deck located on the 10th floor of Aloha Tower to admire the views of the harbor and the cityscape.

            From that view, you might be able to see the <strong>Iolani Palace</strong>. This royal residence was built in 1845 under the orders of the third king of Hawai'i. At first, it was called Hale Ali'i often the place where official events and banquets wereheld. Afterwards, King Kamehameha III had an additional building next to the palace constructed called Hoihoikea where he can live comfortably.

            Two monarchs later, King Kamehameha V renamed the palace as Iolani Palace in 1863 to honor his deceased brother and predecessor King Kamehameha IV, whose birth name was Alexander Liholiho. This was because Iolani, meaning bird of heaven, was one of Liholiho's Hawaiian names, as well as a name the belonged to King Kamehameha II.

            From that location, you can walk one block to <strong>Kawaiaha'o Church</strong>. This church sits on land granted to the first missionaries to arrive to Hawaii in 1820. Starting from a thatched roof, the congregation was slowly growing. On July 31, 1838, creation of the church's foundation begun. Known as the "Stone Church," materials for this church is actually coral from ocean reefs that were quarried from underwater and transported. Locals dove 10-20 feet to hand-chisel pieces from the reef and raised them to the surface. After five years of labor, the church was ready for dedication ceremonies, which the main benefactor King Kamehameha III attended.

            In honor of the generous king, the clock tower was given the king's Hawaiian name Kauikeaouli. Today, the bell still rings on its original machinery. When you enter the church, you can see portraits of the Hawaiian royalty hanging on the walls of the upper level. These portraits are part of a collection by one artist in only one location.
