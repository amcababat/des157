            However, if you are one who wants to know how royalty lived, you can visit <strong>Hulihe'e Palace</strong>. This royal residence was built in 1838 out of lava rock, coral lime mortar, and koa and ohia timbers under the orders of Governor John Adams Kuakini. This palace served as his home until his death in 1844. The residence was passed down to his adopted son William Pitt Leleiohoku, who died only a few months later. This left the palace to his wide Princess Ruth Ke'elikolani who opened the palace to Hawaiian monarchy. Due to that hospitality, every Hawaiian monarch from Kamehameha III to Queen Liliuokalani spent their time at this residence.

            In 1925, the palace was purchased by the Territory of Hawaii and turned over to and organization called the Daughters of Hawaii. The organization's mission is "to perpetuate the memory and spirit of old Hawaii and of historic face, and to preserve the nomenclature and correct pronunciation of the Hawaiian language." Forty-eight years later, the Hulihe'e Palace was placed on the National Register of Historic Sites.
